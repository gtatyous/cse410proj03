Student NetID: gtatyous (Yousef Gtat), I am working alone.

Compilation tested on: ned, carl, marge and skinner

Command for compile: make

Command to run: ./proj3 fileName/DirectoryName

comments: if no files or directories were provided, the code will notify the user and terminate. If a file name is provided, the code will check if there is already a Bizzaro version and if this is the case, the program will notify the user and terminate. If it is not, a Bizzaro version of the file will be created in the same directory. If the provided is a directory name, then the code will recursively apply Bizzaro on all files and sub-directories inside of it with no exceptions.
